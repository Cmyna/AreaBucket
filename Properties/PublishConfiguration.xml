	<LongDescription>
    (BETA) A mod provides tool like Cities XL decoration tool,
    should works on any prefab that can be created by vanilla surface/area tool(District, Lots, Surfaces, MapTiles, etcs.).
    Now the tool will try to detect nearby roads/building lots/surface as filling boundaries.

    Please feel free to ask any questions, 
    bugs or suggestions can be posted here, you can also see some demostration video for this tool: 
    https://discord.com/channels/1024242828114673724/1237985243420561479

    After installing the mod, you can see extra "Area Bucket" switch button on tool options panel when picking any surface assets,
    press to active it and more tool's options will be shown.

    ## IMPORTANT NOTES
    Two experimental options(sun net boudaries, check crossing boundaries) have serious performance issues.
    They will slow down the FPS on large filling range. Be careful to use them

    ### Assets that can use this tool:
    * Surfaces, including custom surfaces assets
    ### Assets that can not use this tool currently (plan to bring this tool for those assets in the future):
    * Specialized Industries Lot
    * Garbage LandFill Lot
    * Districts
    * MapTiles

    The mod now is on beta progress, known issues below:
    * Pool performance for some options in large filling range (sub net boundaries, detect boundaries crossing,
    significatly slower fps when filling range is over 50m)
    * "Invalid Shape" notification happens offen, but the filling areas can still be plopped.
    * still generate some gaps when filling, especially on the boundaries crossing
    (enable experimental options and active boundaries crossing in tool option can alleviate the problem)
